      <h2>Hello.</h2>

        <h3>Computers</h3>
        <p>I have always loved computers and games as long as I can remember. I always pretended to be a hacker/programmer when I was younger and am now pursuing it as a career.

        <h3>Music</h3>
        <p>I have had a love for music as well, not just listening; but also playing it. I can play a little of quite a few instruments, but I played saxophone for about 7 years.
          My main love though is the guiter I have played it now for almost 20 years.</p>
